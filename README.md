# Senéhorario Frontend

This is the frontend for **Senéhorario**, a web application designed to help students at Uniandes build optimal class schedules.

The frontend is built with Angular and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting courses, viewing available schedules, and interacting with the backend API.

## Try It Online

You can use Senéhorario directly in your browser, no installation required:

- **Live site:** [https://cmolina.xyz/senehorario/](https://cmolina.xyz/senehorario/)

## Current Features

- Search the Uniandes catalog by NRC, course code, or name, with section details (professors, term/cycle, meeting times).
- Pick sections for each course and see how many you’ve chosen, with a quick view of the current course’s selected sections.
- Automatic checks for required lab/main pairings so you don’t build invalid schedules.
- Generate all compatible schedule options from your chosen sections and step through them.
- Interactive weekly calendar preview with color-coded classes; click any class to see its section details.
- Planner state saves in your browser (selected sections, course info, schedule options) so you can resume later.
